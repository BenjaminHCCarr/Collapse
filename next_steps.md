# Next steps - Literature review to write introduction

## Construct annotated bibliography

We want to be confident that we can contribute a novel and useful result, so we need to read the relevant literature. We'll build a list of papers we (as a group) need to read and understand in order to be confident that we're doing something new. To do this we need to 

- Check papers written by previous NCEAS working groups which used the Ram Myers database to answer questions about global stock status (likely to be closest to overlapping with us).
	+ [Worm working group](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/projects/6860) [**Edgar**, **Vanessa**]
		+ make sure both people scan each reference, good to have multiple opinions
	+ [Hilborn and Worm working group](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/projects/12109) [**Annie**, **Nina**, **Ingrid**]
		+ make sure both people scan each reference, good to have multiple opinions
	+ Scan current literature to find papers on what causes collapse of fish populations [**Ben**, **Emma**]

Annie is going to make sure the Hilborn group happens, and Edgar is going to make sure the Worm group happens. 

For each paper that we scan and think is important, also scan all papers that have cited it. Then  we'll put the scanned references in a table formatted as below:

first author | year | journal | DOI | relevance | short note
------------ | ---- | ------- | --- | --------- | --------
Costello     | 2012 | Nature  | 10.1126/science.1223389 |  high     |uses regression model to estimate what covariates predict stock status. extremely similar to our approach [**emma**]. also does other cool stuff [**nina**]. 

Goal: have list completed by August 23rd (2 weeks)

## Close reading

After we build a list of important sources, we'll split up and each take a section of papers to read. We'll each be responsible for closely reading and effectively summarizing in paper, paying particularly close attention to which data sources were used, covariates estimated, etc. More detailed summaries will be added in an additional column "detailed notes."

first author | year | journal | DOI | relevance | short note | detailed notes
------------ | ---- | ------- | --- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------
Costello     | 2012 | Science  | 10.1126/science.1223389 |  high     | uses regression model to estimate what covariates predict stock status. extremely similar to our approach [**emma**]. also does other cool stuff [**nina**].  | [to be added]

Goal: have this completed by October first (2 months)

## Misc

+ Don't keep papers in the github, makes it too bulky. Put references in `refs.bib` formatted as google scholar does see [here](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=Biodiversity+and+the+functioning+of+seagrass+ecosystems&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C34&as_sdtp=), then click `export to bibtex` for example, should look like [this](http://scholar.google.com/scholar.bib?q=info:27QfS2JoLPgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&hl=en&ct=citation&cd=0). Then copy and paste into `refs.bib`. 
+ Can use [http://dx.doi.org](http://dx.doi.org) to get access to papers.
