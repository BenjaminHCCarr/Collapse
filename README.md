## Examination of the Causes of Fisheries Collapse
### A Continuation of an NCEAS/RENCI OSS2014 Working Group
 
In fisheries, the probability of a stock collapsing varies strongly from region to region but the mechanism is unknown. We'd like to use the naturally occurring variation among regions as recorded in publicly available data (e.g. the Ram-Myers fisheries stock database, remotely sensed oceanographic variables, continuous plankton records) to assess the relative importance of abiotic variables, food web interactions, and economic pressures in determining the "baseline" abundance for collapsed fisheries and marine mammal populations.
