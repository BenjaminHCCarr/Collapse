Question: Does region explain probability of collapse, does region predict likelihood of recovery, and why?

1. Define "stock collapse"
	- Use 20% of B_msy (traditional fisheries definition)
	- Change point analysis?
		*  
2. Define "stock recovery"
	- No longer collapsed

Questions: 

1. Do we use FAO landings?
2. Are there properties of time series that are interesting?
	- Is this related to stock assessment model used?
	- Is this related to region?
	- Is this related to species? 

Roles

- Ingrid: would like to work in R more, likes cool graphs
- Nina: Would like to learn manage these databases and put it up on git. Pretty good with statistical analyses. 
- Annie: wants to learn how to approach a dataset and figure out the best statistical analyses
- Edgar: Love working in R, knows AD model builder
- Ben: want to learn, happy to work on whatever, has a fisheries background. Knows catch to MSY skill
- Emma: loves to code. knows some fish stuff. 
- Vanessa: get good at R, coding, dealing with big datasets. 


Tasks

1. DONE: Plot time series of total biomass, spawning stock biomass, recruits. Make sure units are the same. [Edgar & Nina]
	- plot by region
	- plot by management organization
	- plot by species (hardest)
2. Plot conventional collapse definition and calculate B_msy for stock assessment [Emma]
2.5 calculate B_msy - landings [Ben]
3. Literature review [Ingrid, Vanessa, Annie]
	- start writing introduction
	- What definitions of collapse exist, have been used?
	- What data is typically used? Stock assessments?
	- Set up collective mendeley file
4. Make a map each region is shaded grey, each management agency is cross hatched to see spatial coverage. i.e. figure out spatial coverage
	- N = how many species. 
	- That will let us match environmental data. 
5.
