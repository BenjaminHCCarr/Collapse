+ Problem: all stocks have the same lat/lon of LME. Current solution: added noise so that they'd each have unique position. This is a work-around. This is not what we want to do for a MS. Think this would be an essential task at some point. 
	+ We could geo-code the area names and then jitter around those that are in the same area. 

+ Need confident 0-1 data. Do serious quality control. It's important to visually inspect each stock, so need a column that's in each 
	+ need to compare across estimates: do a regression observed to predicted. 
	+ how many ADMB are constrained?
	+ need to plot each stock, print whether there's a collapse, and each collapse threshold. 
		+ spit out each plot so we can visually inspect. 
+ Need to add a few columns to stocks.csv
	+ common name [x]
	+ year they collapsed
	+ year the time series started
	+ year of the start of the entire dataset. Probably 1945, unless there's a ton of data right before or right after. 
		+ Then re-do the 0-1 data because it only matters if they collapse after that point. 
	+ final 0-1
+ also think about adding columns for recovery
	+ what year
	+ yes, no
	+ and then repeating for as many times as the stock collapses.
