Database description:
Approximately 9.0 million measurements of surface water pCO2 made over
the global oceans during 1957-2013 have been processed to make a
uniform data file in this Version 2013. Measurements made in open
oceans as well as in coastal waters are included. The data assembled
include only those measured using equilibrator-CO2 analyzer systems,
and have been quality-controlled based upon the stability of the
system performance, the reliability of calibrations for CO2 analysis
and the internal consistency of data. In order to allow re-examination
of the data in the future, a number of measured parameters relevant to
pCO2 in seawater are listed. The overall uncertainty for the pCO2
values listed is estimated to be Â± 2.5 uatm on the average. However,
as discussed in Section 5, errors up to about 5 uatm are possible when
underway measurements were made across high SST gradient areas due to
time lag of sample water transit from the intake to the
equilibrator. The names and institutional affiliations of the
contributors are listed in Table 1. A column is added for reporting
the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater in units of Pascals. The
documentations for the previous versions (V1.0, V2007, V2008, V2009,
V2010, 2011, and V2012) of LDEO database are available at CDIAC

The global pCO2 data set is available free of charge as a numeric data
package (NDP) from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
(CDIAC). The NDP consists of the oceanographic data files and this
printed documentation, which describes the procedures and methods used
to obtain the data.

"lme_average_PCO2.csv" this file contains values for the average, the Standard Deviation, and the number of observations from the original database in each LME used to calculate the average pCO2 for each Large Marine Ecosystem (LME). Fields are described as follows:

LME_NUMBER is the official Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) number, from 1 to 66

LME_NAME is the official Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) Name

AVG_PCO2 is the average monthly pCO2 (uatm) in surface water at SST calculated from the original LDEO_Database_V2013 pCO2 dataset for each LME polygon using QGIS.

VAR_PCO2 is the Standard Deviation of monthly pCO2 (uatm) from the original LDEO_Database_V2013 pCO2 dataset calculated for each LME polygon using QGIS.

NUM_obs is the number of monthly pCO2 (uatm) observations from the original LDEO_Database_V2013 pCO2 dataset in each LME polygon (used to calculate the LME average and Standard Deviation)
