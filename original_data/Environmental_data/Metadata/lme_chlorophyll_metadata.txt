Data collected by Vanessa Michelou from http://onesharedocean.org/public_store/lmes_chla/tmp/67_regions_chl_long_term_mean.csv
on 08/01/2014


"lme_chlorophyll_long_term_mean.csv" contains long terms trends of monthly Chlorophyll-A values in mg.m-3 for all Large Marine Ecosystem areas. 

Measurement methods and calculation: 
Primary productivity estimates originate from ocean color sensors and satellites including the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua and MODIS-Terra). A large archive of in situ near surface chlorophyll data, and satellite SST measurements made by Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on NOAA satellites is used to quantify spatial and seasonal variability of near-surface chlorophyll and SST. Plankton can also be measured over decadal time scales by continuous plankton recorder systems as deployed by the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) from commercial vessels of opportunity.

Scale: 
Globally for all Large Marine Ecosystems, Annual trends 1996-2013

Product: LMEs Monthly Chlorophyll-A and long term trends

dataset:
Comma separated text file (csv) for the Long term averages of each 66 Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) and the Pacific Warm Pool, one line per LME.
For each line:
LME,LME_NUM,N,M_MIN,M_MAX,MIN,MAX,MEAN
LME: LME name
LME_NUM: LME code number
M_MIN: month of the minimum in the monthly averaged series
M_MAX: month of the maximum in the monthly averaged series
MIN: minimum of the monthly averaged series
MAX: maximum of the monthly averaged series
MEAN: mean of the series (see below the description of the series). The value correspond to a chlorophyll-a concentration. Units: mg/cubic meter (mg/m3).

Series dataset description: 
Time series of chlorophyll-A, per LME and the Pacific warm pool, from late 1996 to early 2014.
Units: mg/cubic meter (mg/m3)
