%%INTRODUCE LMES, LIMITATIONS AND ADDITIONS FOR OPEN OCEAN SPECIES. SAME FOR FAO AREAS 
%Large Marine Ecosystems were defined by NOAA \citep{NOAA:LME64:1998}.
%They encompass the continental shelves of the world's oceans and
%represent the most productive areas of the oceans.  However, they do
%not include a classification category for large migratory species such
%as tuna that also inhabit the open ocean and is not associated with
%given LMEs. Each species of highly migratory species is also observed
%in a number of LMEs. While the global coverage of LMEs is beneficial
%to classify assessments from around the world, it is debatable whether
%once can use each LME as an independent unit of comparison. 

%There are important geographic biases in the amount of assessments
%entered per LME (Figure~\ref{fig:lmes}). A large proportion of
%assessments come from North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand
%and the High Seas. Few assessments are entered from regions such as
%Southeast Asia, South America, and the Indian Ocean (outside
%Australian waters). The question of geographic bias relates to
%whether: \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)] \item an assessment is
%  conducted on a stock; \item it is possible to access the assessment;
%  and \item the non-exhaustive collation we undertook may have
%  overlooked the assessment \end{inparaenum}. Whether an assessment is
%conducted for a given stock depends upon a multitude of factors,
%including the economic value of the stock and availability of fiscal
%resources to collect the data required for an assessment. How
%accessible assessments are for entry depends upon the transparency and
%access policies of the relevant management agencies, which varies
%geographically. Similarly, the legal context where fisheries are
%prosecuted will strongly influence the requirement for conducting
%stock assessments. In the United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Act
%defines what stocks are to be monitored and managed, hence a large
%number of the assessments in the RAM Legacy database are under the
%jurisdiction of the US National Marine Fisheries Services.

%Our incomplete search for assessments could also give rise to
%geographic biases, as concerted collation efforts have only been
%conducted in those assessment-rich regions of Figure~\ref{fig:lmes}.
%It is hoped that readers of this article can assist in correcting
%these biases by participating in future updates of the RAM Legacy
%database.
